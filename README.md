# Problem #1

### Issue to solve

There's a full login process already implemented in the code sample, including the JWT refresh process.

However, **there's an issue for parallel requests when the JWT expires**:

- If several API calls are made in parallel, **all of them trigger the /refresh process**.

### Expected behaviour

- If several API calls are made in parallel, **only one /refresh process is triggered**.

### Context

Visiting any page in this project makes, at least, these two API:

- /brands -> Data for the Brand selector (left side of the Header bar)
- /users/me -> Data for the User section (right side of the Header bar)

First time calling these endpoints might take up to 45 seconds to reply, but then they'll respond in less than a second.

![See this image portraying how these two calls trigger TWO refresh calls](/images/problem_1_capture.png)

### Mock environment

A mock API has been built for the purpose of this challenge.

This mock API _exposes an altered JWT generation process_, with the purpose of making the Problem #1 scenario easy to reproduce.

To do so, it always returns an expired JWT token, making our frontend code sample to _always_ trigger the /refresh process.

It also accepts any credentials for the /login endpoint, making the login form a bit meaningless (fill it with anything).

### How to reproduce

If you start the project (see #Starting Steps below) and fill the login form (any credentials will work), you will end up in the dashboard page.

- Open the browser developer tools
- Refresh the page
- Check on the Network tab how TWO calls to /refresh have been made

### Acceptance criteria

- If you start the project (see #Starting Steps below) and fill the login form (any credentials will work), you will end up in the dashboard page.
- Open the browser developer tools
- Refresh the page
- Only ONE call to /refresh has been made

### Is this really an issue?

This is really a question for you, actually:

In a production environment, with a proper JWT generating API, and a proper JWT refresh process: **Why can the Problem #1 scenario be an issue?**

Provide an answer below:

_A refresh token allows the application to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. This avoids the need for the user to provide their credentials frequently, such as every time the short-lived access token expires. Keeping this issue unresolved could lead to two main problems:_

_- **Performance issues**: As the user base grows and the number of components using the `AuthedService` increases, the server will start receiving an ever-increasing volume of refresh requests, slowing the overall response time or even causing it to crash._

_- **Race conditions**: For a single user making multiple concurrent requests, if the first request successfully refreshes the token and updates localStorage, but a second overlapping request fails and clears localStorage, the valid token from the first request will be lost, causing the user to be logged out._

# Problem #2

### Issue to solve

We need a new page holding information about all the users on our platform.

### Context

Using the different assets present in the code sample:

Create a whole new page, called Users

- It has to be visitable from the sidebar, with title Users
- It should be rendered under the /users path
- It should get the users info from https://dummyjson.com/users
- It should display an Ant Design table that:
  - Has the columns:
    - ID
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Name (full name in one column)
    - Email
    - Image (render decision lies on you, show the best option for images you can think of, and justify it in a comment in the code)
    - Client side pagination, 13 elements per page
  - Rows can be ordered by email
  - Rows can be filtered by First name, and Last name.
  - Loading behaviour while the data is being fetched

- https://ant.design/components/overview/
- https://dummyjson.com

### Acceptance criteria

- If you start the project (see #Starting Steps below) and fill the login form (any credentials will work), you will end up in the dashboard page.
- There's a Users section in the Sidebar
- Visiting the Users sections loads a table with 13 elements, and several pages in the pagination section
- Changing to page 2 displays 13 different rows
- Clicking on the Email column changes the order of the rows, ordering ASC or DESC depending on the arrow displayed
- Writing "Miles" on the First name filter results in ONE row, with ID=4
- Deleting the text in the First name filter returns the table to its original state
- Writing "Cummerata" on the Last name filter results in ONE row, with ID=4
- Deleting the text in the Last name filter returns the table to its original state

> EXTRA POINTS: WRITE HERE ANY EXTRA COMMENTS OR NOTES YOU FIND RELEVANT

_Overview of the main components created for Problem #2:_

### _UsersService_

_Following the same pattern used for other entities, `services/users` extends from `AuthedService` and includes both the real `api.ts` and the `fake.ts`, making it possible to switch between them by toggling the environment variable `REACT_APP_FAKE_API_MODE`. The `api.ts` endpoint is optimized to fetch all users in a single request, retrieving only the necessary fields (**https://dummyjson.com/users?limit=0&select=id,firstName,lastName,email,image**)._

### _Custom React Query Hook (useGetUsers)_

_I chose to implement a custom React Query hook (`useGetUsers`) rather than expanding on `useCRUDBuilder` because the requirements explicitly specify that the `Users` page should list all users, not just users related to a given brand. Some notes about the `useGetUsers` hook:_

- `staleTime`**:** Defines how long the cached data is considered "fresh." During this period, React Query will serve the cached data without re-fetching it from the server. The value of 5 minutes can be adjusted according to real-world usage expectations.\*
- `retry`**:** Specifies how many times React Query should retry the `queryFn` (data fetching function) in case of a failure. This enhances resilience in cases of temporary network issues.\*

### _Users Page (antd columns, filtering + useMemo, internationalization)_

_The `useGetUsers` hook is used here to fetch data from the server and handle all 5 UI states. The implementation makes proper use of TypeScript, such as when defining the Ant Design `ColumnsType`. The Ant Design `<Image>` component is used for better performance and built-in features (see comments in the code)._

_The table headers for `firstName` and `lastName` were replaced with input fields that serve as filtering inputs. These are handled by `handleFilterChange`, which uses lodashâ€™s `debounce` method for improved UX and performance. The actual data rendered at any given point is stored in the `filteredData` variable, which is calculated using a `useMemo` that depends only on the `data` and the applied `filters`._

_To ensure a consistent user experience, all static strings in the `Users` page have been internationalized using `react-intl`. Both English (`en.json`) and Spanish (`es.json`) translations are included in this implementation._

### _Notes on Testing Attempts_

_**Due to Jest configuration issues, tests could not be executed successfully**. The example below demonstrates a unit test for the `Users` page, simulating the loading state and verifying the correct UI behavior. The test uses the `useGetUsers` hook, mocking its return values to reflect the loading state and asserting the presence of the loading spinner:_

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Users } from "./index";
import { useGetUsers } from "hooks/react-query/users/useGetUsers";

jest.mock("hooks/react-query/users/useGetUsers");

describe("Users Page", () => {
  it("renders loading spinner when data is loading", () => {
    // mock the new React Query hook
    (useGetUsers as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({
      data: null,
      isLoading: true,
      isError: false,
    });

    render(<Users />);

    // assert that the loading spinner is visible
    expect(screen.getByText(/Loading users.../i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### _Attempts to Resolve Jest Issues_

_Attempts to configure Jest included overriding CRA's default settings using `react-app-rewired` and `customize-cra`. Adjustments to Jest's `transformIgnorePatterns` were made to explicitly include the `antd` modules. Various Babel configurations (via `.babelrc` and `babel.config.js`) were also tested to ensure proper transformation of JSX syntax and the `antd` library, but these efforts were unsuccessful._

### _Proposed Solution for Resolving Jest Configuration Issues_

_To resolve the Jest configuration issues, I would propose initializing a new CRA project but ensuring that Jest and React Testing Library (RTL) tests work from the beginning. The existing codebase could then be incrementally migrated into the new project, with tests performed at each step to ensure functionality. This approach would effectively isolate and address any misconfigurations or dependency conflicts._

## TECH CONTEXT

# Starting Steps

- npm i
- create a .env with the following key-value pairs
  - REACT_APP_API_URL=https://fake-api-owmo.onrender.com/dev
  - REACT_APP_FAKE_API_MODE=false
- npm start

# Data Loading (FAKE API MODE)

REACT_APP_FAKE_API_MODE ENV VAR switches whole application between FAKE and API modes

FAKE MODE

- FakeService class helps reproducing errors and long load times
- JSON Mocking (locally or any easy mocking service works)

API MODE

- ApiService class helps connecting to external APIs ('fetch' wrapper)

PROS of developing UIs this way

When a feature is requested, given that the tech team builds a JSON CONTRACT (accurate definition of how needed API endpoints will behave, both requests and responses)

- Backend and Frontend can start working on their implementations _in parallel_. No dependencies from the very beginning.
- Frontend can work on the [5 UI states](https://medium.com/@pakhimangal/ui-states-are-important-74c2715cef0b) thanks to our FakeService class. Actually, it may be even easier for some of the states (Loading, for instance, can be forced to be quite long)
- Whenever backend development is ready, the integration phase is just toggling a boolean! (if the JSON Contract was respected during the development, that is)
- EXTRA VALUE: FAKE mode can be used as a Demo/Playground environment out of the box!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
